Numpoly is a generic library for creating, manipulating polynomial arrays.

``numpoly`` is a subclass of ``numpy.ndarray`` and as such is compatible with
most ``numpy`` functions, where that makes sense.

Installation
------------

Installation should be straight forward::

    pip install numpoly

And you should be ready to go.
